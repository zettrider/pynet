Read the 'show_ipv6_intf.txt' file.

From this file use Python regular expressions to extract the two IPv6 addresses.

The two relevant IPv6 addresses you need to extract are:

    2001:11:2233::a1/24
    2001:cc11:22bb:0:2ec2:60ff:fe4f:feb2/64

Try to use re.DOTALL flag as part of your search. Your search pattern should not include any of
the literal characters in the IPv6 address.

From this, create a list of IPv6 addresses that includes only the above two addresses.

Print this list to the screen.
