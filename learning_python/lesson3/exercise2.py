"""
Read the contents of the "show_arp.txt" file. Using a for loop, iterate over the lines of this
file. Process the lines of the file and separate out the ip_addr and mac_addr for each entry into a
separate variable.

Add a conditional statement that searches for '10.220.88.1'. If 10.220.88.1 is found, print out the
string "Default gateway IP/Mac" and the corresponding IP address and MAC Address.

Using a conditional statement, also search for '10.220.88.30'. If this IP address is found, then
print out "Arista3 IP/Mac is" and the corresponding ip_addr and mac_addr.

Keep track of whether you have found both the Default Gateway and the Arista3 switch. Once you have
found both of these devices, 'break' out of the for loop.
