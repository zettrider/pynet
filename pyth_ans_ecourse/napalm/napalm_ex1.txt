pynet-rtr1   (Cisco IOS)    184.105.247.70
pynet-rtr2   (Cisco IOS)    184.105.247.71
pynet-sw1    (Arista EOS)   184.105.247.72
pynet-sw2    (Arista EOS)   184.105.247.73
juniper-srx                 184.105.247.76

Retrieve the 'model' number from each device and print the model to standard out.

As part of this exercise define the devices that you use in a Python file (for 
example my_devices.py) and import these devices into your program. Optionally, 
define the devices in a YAML file and read this my_devices.yml file in.
